Hey, I'm Sadman Shami. I enjoy working with React.js Astro.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences. I do love playing minecraft and watching anime.

User of Arch Linux for more than half year.

I use VSCode for daily development, but I also sometimes use Neovim on Arch.

✓ Games, ✓ Anime, like listening to musics.

I am very interested in things I have never touched, such as building a blog.

You can reach me through [Email](mailto:srahyme413@gmail.com).
